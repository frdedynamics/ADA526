# Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)
For exchanging information between all the hardware and software components of your robot, we use the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2).

You find the [resources for ROS 2](https://frdedynamics.github.io/hvl_robotics_website/courses/ada526) on our HVL Robotics Lab website.

In addition, you may have a look at the official [ROS 2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html). Keep in mind that the official tutorials cover many more topics than we need for this course.
