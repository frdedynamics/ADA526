# Project
The project is central to ADA526. In the project you will perhaps learn the most and have the most fun!


## Kinematic Structure
You can choose one of three pre-defined kinematic structures. The relative orientations of the joints are fixed, but you should modify the link lengths and offsets such that your robot has sufficient reach.

### DH Parameters (Optional)
Denavit-Hartenberg parameters are what's behind the formal definition of the kinematic structure.
