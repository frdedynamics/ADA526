# Welcome to ADA526 - Applied Robot Prototyping
In this course you will learn about robot prototyping by designing, building and programming your own robot manipulator.
Robots are complex systems of closely intertwined hardware and software components. When designing a new robot, engineers have to consider how complexity and functionality is distributed between hardware and software components.
